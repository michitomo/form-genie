## Introduction (0:00-0:20)

Hello, I'm Michitomo.

Do you hate filling out online forms? Typing your name, address, email, phone number... the same information again and again?

It's frustrating. It wastes your time.

Today I'll show you Form Genie - a browser extension that uses AI to fill forms intelligently.

## Problem: Chrome Auto-fill Fails (0:20-1:10)

Your browser has auto-fill, but it often fails on complex forms. Let me show you.

Here is a typical registration form. I'll use Chrome's built-in auto-fill.

Watch what happens... Chrome filled some fields, but look at the problems:

First, my name is "O'Reilly" with an apostrophe. Chrome filled it, but see this error? The form doesn't accept special characters. I have to manually fix this to "OReilly".

Second, the country code for the phone number is empty. Chrome doesn't understand this split format.

Third, the date of birth. Chrome didn't fill these dropdown menus at all. I have to click through and select the month, day, and year manually.

And fourth, the address. Chrome put my full address including apartment number in Address Line 1, but Address Line 2 is empty. Some forms require these separately. 

So even with Chrome's auto-fill, I still have to fix multiple fields manually. This is the problem with traditional auto-fill.

## Solution: Form Genie (1:10-1:40)

Now let me show you Form Genie. I already have my personal information saved in Form Genie.

Let's try the same form again.

The form is empty. I'll use Form Genie.

I click "Fill with Form Genie" and... done! In one second, everything is filled correctly.

Look at the results: The name is "OReilly" without the apostrophe - no validation error. The date of birth dropdowns are all selected correctly. Address Line 1 and Line 2 are properly separated. And the country code "+1" is filled separately from the phone number.

Form Genie's AI analyzed the form and filled each field intelligently using my saved information.

## Form 2: Different Format, Same Intelligence (1:40-2:10)

Now here's where Form Genie really shines. Let me show you a completely different registration form.

(Open us-form2.html)

Look at this form. The layout is completely different - name split into three fields with middle initial, phone number wants brackets format, date as MM/DD/YYYY text, state dropdown, ZIP code in two parts.

Same information, but every field formatted differently.

With Form Genie...

(Click Form Genie icon and select "My US Profile")

Done! Everything filled correctly and formatted to match this form's requirements.

Form Genie's AI understood this completely different structure and adapted my data automatically.

## Conclusion (2:10-2:30)

With Form Genie, you can stop wasting time on forms. No matter how complex or different the format, Form Genie understands and fills it correctly.

All your data is processed safely in your browser, on your computer. No cloud, no servers.

Thank you for watching. Try Form Genie and make your online life easier!
